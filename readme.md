[Make a Location-Based Web App With Django and GeoDjango](https://realpython.com/location-based-app-with-geodjango-tutorial/)

## Key steps
* Postgresql:
    * Install on your OS.
    * Install pgadmin4 or your preferred postgres client app for management.
    * Learn concepts of default postgress database, user, and role as this can be confusing.
    * Understand managing your postgres databases using psql.
    * Be able to create a user and edit their privileges using both pgadmin4 AND psql.
    * Learn to use both psql and pgadmin4 for editing postgres extensions.
* Django:
    * Understand the difference between creating a django project and an application within that project. Directory, folder structure and naming conventions can be confusing.
* Virtual Python Environments:
    * Choose and master your approach as there are several.
    * I prefer the python built in library for this (venv). This method requires no extra libraries or installations. However, I can see the value in virtualenv, pycharm, and anaconda for managing many projects. There is a sea of online tutorials for understanding the differences. I think [Venvs & Pyenvs & Pipenvs, OH MY!](https://towardsdatascience.com/venvs-pyenvs-pipenvs-oh-my-2411149e2f43) is the article which pushed me venv.
